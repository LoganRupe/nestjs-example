## About

This is a NestJS example used as a testing area.

This is built with (`RestJS`, `Fastify`, `Yarn`, `Typescript`, `Docker`).

## Local Development
NOTE: Best to use Docker/3M for development. See: [Docker 3M Development (preferred)](#docker-3m-development-preferred)

To run locally:

1. Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/LoganRupe/nestjs-example
```

2. Build using the following commands

```bash
nvm install #or nvm use
yarn install
yarn debug
```

## Docker and 3M

### Prerequisites

On Windows or Mac, make sure you have installed: 
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker).


### The 3 Musketeers Commands (Make)

You can use the following [3 Musketeers](https://3musketeers.io) Make commands to build, test, and run the containerised app:

```bash
# Runs common CI/CD commands
make install
make build
make test
make dev
make debug
make lint

# Builds a prod container locally. You can omit IMAGE_NAME
make build_container IMAGE_NAME="<your-image-name>"

# Builds and runs a prod container. Uses the .env vars
# Visit http://localhost:3000/health
make start_container

# Builds prod container and opens a shell. Uses the .env vars
make debug_container

# Cleans up any left over containers containers
make clean

# Cleans up left over containers, images, and volumes.
# This will make subsequent 3M runs much slower
make sweep
```

The 3M approach allows you to replicate locally, build-server/production behaviour. Running commands like `make test`,
`make build`, etc starts the same container image and process as buid-server stages.

### Docker 3M Development **(preferred)**

To run (uses make to use Docker):

1. Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/LoganRupe/nestjs-example
```

2. Build using the following commands

```bash
make install
make debug
```

### Build production container

Run the following commands:

```
make build_container
```
